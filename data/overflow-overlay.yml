title: "Firefox doesn't support the non-standard `overflow: overlay` setting"
severity: low
tags:
  - css

symptoms:
  - Some sites have text that overflows their boxes in Firefox where the overflow is hidden behind a scrollbar in Webkit and Chrome.

solutions:
  notes:
    - Firefox should treat overflow:overlay as an alias for overflow:auto, but we'd need a special tweak to make scrollbars overlay.
  workarounds:
    - "Web Developers can try `overflow-y: auto; overflow-x: hidden` with `width: 100vh` rather than `overflow: overlay`."
