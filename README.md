# The Web Compatibility Knowledge Base

This repository contains a subset of the Web Compatibility teams' knowledge about real-world site breakage. With this collection, we hope to

- ease some diagnosis tasks by offering a searchable collection of already known breakage and their symptoms,
- inform Firefox engineering prioritization,
- share knowledge between members of the Web Compatibility team.

Please note that this is still an early **work in progress**, and everything in this repo can and will change. Therefore, you should not rely on the data without consulting the WebCompat team first!
